A few captivating dialogues from my mom's favorite movie [Pakeeza (1975)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067546/):

*Ye kisi daldal par kohre se bani hu haveli hai.*

This mansion is built on a swamp, shrouded in mist.

---

*Aap soti rahin lekin aapke pair jaagte rahe,*
*Aur mere hosh-o-hawaas se khelte rahe.*

You slept, but your feet remained awake,
Playing with my senses and consciousness.

---

*Is ghar ke insaanon ko har saans ke baad doosre saans ke liye bhi aapki ijazat leni padti hai,*
*Aur aapki aulad khuda ki banaai hu zameen par nahi, aapke banaye hue hatheli par rengti hai.*

The people of this house need your permission for every breath they take,
And your children crawl not on God's created earth, but on the palm of your hand.

---

*Tum shayad apne aap ko bhool chuki ho,*
*Lekin mujhe yakeen ho gaya hai tum koi aur nahi meri taqdeer ho.*

You may have forgotten yourself,
But I've become certain that you are none other than my destiny.
